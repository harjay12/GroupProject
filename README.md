Operating System | Bridgewater State University.                                               Fall - 2019
Build an Operating System from Scratch/Team coordinator                                                                     

This project was a group project work compose of three-person including myself Saint Aime, Jean Harold as project coordinator 
Shardow-Suberu, Dansalah as project chief software engineer and Lopes, Josh as consultants.
We all worked together to create an Operating System using C Programming Language to execute: 
write, read, saved, terminate, and delete files via a command line. 

tools that was necessary for this project were:

	Emumaker86 - An x86 processor simulator
	PuTTY or some other SSH client - essential if you don't have a Linux computer
	bcc (Bruce Evan's C Compiler) - A 16-bit C compiler
	as86, ld86 - A 16 bit assembler and linker that typically comes with bcc
	gcc - The standard 32-bit GNU C compiler
	nasm - The Netwide Assembler
	hexedit - A utility that allows you to edit a file in hexadecimal byte-by-byte
	dd - A standard low-level copying utility.  This generally comes with UNIX.
	pico, nano, or vi - A simple text-based editor
